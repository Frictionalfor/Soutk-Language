# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The SOUTK programming language currently has multiple interpreter implementations scattered across different files (`soutk_enhanced.py`, `soutk_interpreter.py`, `soutk_ultimate.py`) and a main entry point that references a non-existent `src/soutk_interpreter.py`. This feature will create a unified, comprehensive main interpreter file that consolidates the best features from all existing interpreters while supporting the original SOUTK magical keywords (`chant`, `transform`, `forge spell`, `invoke`, etc.) that form the backbone and identity of the SOUTK programming language.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a SOUTK developer, I want a single, comprehensive main interpreter file, so that I can have all language features in one place without confusion about which interpreter to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the main interpreter is created THEN it SHALL consolidate all features from existing interpreter files
2. WHEN the main interpreter is created THEN it SHALL be located at `src/soutk_interpreter.py` to match the existing entry point
3. WHEN the main interpreter is created THEN it SHALL support all original SOUTK magical keywords (`chant`, `transform`, `forge spell`, `invoke`, etc.)
4. WHEN the main interpreter is created THEN it SHALL include all data structures (stacks, queues, linked lists) with magical keywords (`forge stack`, `push`, `pop`, etc.)
5. WHEN the main interpreter is created THEN it SHALL include all core language features (variables, functions, control flow, arrays) using SOUTK syntax
6. WHEN the main interpreter is created THEN it SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing SOUTK programs using magical keywords

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a SOUTK user, I want the interpreter to handle all SOUTK language constructs correctly, so that I can write complex programs with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the interpreter processes variable assignments THEN it SHALL support all data types (strings, numbers, booleans, arrays)
2. WHEN the interpreter processes function definitions THEN it SHALL support parameters, return values, and local scope
3. WHEN the interpreter processes control flow THEN it SHALL support if/else, while loops, for loops, and conditional expressions
4. WHEN the interpreter processes data structures THEN it SHALL support forge, push, pop, peek, enqueue, dequeue, link, unlink operations
5. WHEN the interpreter processes expressions THEN it SHALL handle arithmetic, string concatenation, logical operations, and comparisons
6. WHEN the interpreter processes array operations THEN it SHALL support indexing, assignment, and length operations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a SOUTK developer, I want comprehensive error handling and debugging features, so that I can identify and fix issues in SOUTK programs easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs THEN the interpreter SHALL display the line number where the error occurred
2. WHEN an invalid operation is attempted THEN the interpreter SHALL provide a clear error message
3. WHEN a function is called with wrong parameters THEN the interpreter SHALL validate parameter count and types
4. WHEN undefined variables or functions are referenced THEN the interpreter SHALL report specific error messages
5. WHEN syntax errors occur THEN the interpreter SHALL indicate the problematic line and expected syntax

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a SOUTK user, I want the interpreter to provide interactive features, so that I can create dynamic programs that respond to user input.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the `listen` command is used THEN the interpreter SHALL prompt for and capture user input
2. WHEN the `listen` command includes a prompt THEN the interpreter SHALL display the prompt before waiting for input
3. WHEN the `speak` command is used THEN the interpreter SHALL output text to the console
4. WHEN string interpolation is used THEN the interpreter SHALL substitute variable values correctly
5. WHEN the interpreter encounters EOF or keyboard interrupt THEN it SHALL handle gracefully without crashing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a SOUTK developer, I want the interpreter to be well-structured and maintainable, so that I can easily extend and modify the language features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the interpreter is implemented THEN it SHALL use clear class structure with logical separation of concerns
2. WHEN the interpreter is implemented THEN it SHALL include comprehensive docstrings and comments
3. WHEN the interpreter is implemented THEN it SHALL follow Python best practices for code organization
4. WHEN the interpreter is implemented THEN it SHALL be modular enough to allow easy addition of new features
5. WHEN the interpreter is implemented THEN it SHALL include proper exception handling throughout the codebase
