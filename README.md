- **📚 Data Structures** - Stacks, queues, linked lists, dictionaries (grimoires)
- **📁 File I/O** - Read, write, and append files with `scroll`, `inscribe`, `append`
- **⚠️ Error Handling** - `ward`/`rescue` blocks for robust error management
- **🎨 Object-Oriented** - Classes with `enchant`, objects with `conjure`
- **🧮 Math Library** - Built-in mathematical functions
- **🔤 String Methods** - Advanced string manipulation
- **🔄 Variable Swapping** - Multiple assignment and swapping support
- **� IntePractive Input** - User input with `listen()` function

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed
3. Run Soutk programs with: `python soutk.py your_program.stk`

### Hello World

```soutk
chant "Hello, World!";
```

### Variables and Functions

```soutk
// Variables (no 'summon' needed!)
name = "Soutk Wizard";
level = 50;

// Functions
spell greet(person) {
    chant "Hello, " + person + "!";
}

cast greet(name);
```

### Classes and Objects

```soutk
enchant Wizard {
    spell construct(name, power) {
        this.name = name;
        this.power = power;
    }
    
    spell castSpell(spellName) {
        chant this.name + " casts " + spellName + "!";
    }
}

gandalf = conjure Wizard("Gandalf", 100);
gandalf.castSpell("Fireball");
```
